**WHAT IT DOES**

Sets up the QuizGenerator to use "gemini-pro" model, configure parameters for controlled output, and integrate with vectorstore for context-driven question generation. Then, generates a quiz by looping through questions, ensuring uniqueness with a retry limit, and validating against the question bank.
